\subsection{Recurrent Neural Network
Projects}\label{recurrent-neural-network-projects}

Welcome to the Recurrent Neural Network Project in the Artificial
Intelligence Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has
already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional
functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need
to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that
begin with \textbf{'Implementation'} in the header indicate that the
following block of code will require additional functionality which you
must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the
specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a
'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Note:} Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the
\textbf{Shift + Enter} keyboard shortcut. In addition, Markdown cells
can be edited by typically double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode.
\end{quote}

    \subsubsection{Implementation TODOs in this
notebook}\label{implementation-todos-in-this-notebook}

This notebook contains two problems, cut into a variety of TODOs. Make
sure to complete each section containing a TODO marker throughout the
notebook. For convenience we provide links to each of these sections
below.

Section \ref{todo_1}

Section \ref{todo_2}

    \section{Problem 1: Perform time series
prediction}\label{problem-1-perform-time-series-prediction}

In this project you will perform time series prediction using a
Recurrent Neural Network regressor. In particular you will re-create the
figure shown in the notes - where the stock price of Apple was
forecasted (or predicted) 7 days in advance. In completing this exercise
you will learn how to construct RNNs using Keras, which will also aid in
completing the second project in this notebook.

The particular network architecture we will employ for our RNN is known
as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory}{Long Term
Short Memory (LSTM)}, which helps significantly avoid technical problems
with optimization of RNNs.

    \subsection{1.1 Getting started}\label{getting-started}

First we must load in our time series - a history of around 140 days of
Apple's stock price. Then we need to perform a number of pre-processing
steps to prepare it for use with an RNN model. First off, it is good
practice to normalize time series - by normalizing its range. This helps
us avoid serious numerical issues associated how common activation
functions (like tanh) transform very large (positive or negative)
numbers, as well as helping us to avoid related issues when computing
derivatives.

Here we normalize the series to lie in the range {[}0,1{]} {[}using this
scikit
function{]}(http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html),
but it is also commonplace to normalize by a series standard deviation.

    \subsection{1.2 Cutting our time series into
sequences}\label{cutting-our-time-series-into-sequences}

Remember, our time series is a sequence of numbers that we can represent
in general mathematically as

\[s_{0},s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{P}\]

where \(s_{p}\) is the numerical value of the time series at time period
\(p\) and where \(P\) is the total length of the series. In order to
apply our RNN we treat the time series prediction problem as a
regression problem, and so need to use a sliding window to construct a
set of associated input/output pairs to regress on. This process is
animated in the gif below.

For example - using a window of size T = 5 (as illustrated in the gif
above) we produce a set of input/output pairs like the one shown in the
table below

\[\begin{array}{c|c}
\text{Input} & \text{Output}\\
\hline \color{CornflowerBlue} {\langle s_{1},s_{2},s_{3},s_{4},s_{5}\rangle} & \color{Goldenrod}{ s_{6}} \\
\ \color{CornflowerBlue} {\langle s_{2},s_{3},s_{4},s_{5},s_{6} \rangle } & \color{Goldenrod} {s_{7} } \\
\color{CornflowerBlue}  {\vdots} & \color{Goldenrod} {\vdots}\\
\color{CornflowerBlue} { \langle s_{P-5},s_{P-4},s_{P-3},s_{P-2},s_{P-1} \rangle } & \color{Goldenrod} {s_{P}}
\end{array}\]

Notice here that each input is a sequence (or vector) of length 5 (and
in general has length equal to the window size T) while each
corresponding output is a scalar value. Notice also how given a time
series of length P and window size T = 5 as shown above, we created P -
5 input/output pairs. More generally, for a window size T we create P -
T such pairs.

    Now its time for you to window the input time series as described above!

\textbf{TODO:} Implement the function called
\textbf{window\_transform\_series} in my\_answers.py so that it runs a
sliding window along the input series and creates associated
input/output pairs. Note that this function should input a) the series
and b) the window length, and return the input/output subsequences. Make
sure to format returned input/output as generally shown in table above
(where window\_size = 5), and make sure your returned input is a numpy
array.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

    You can test your function on the list of odd numbers given below

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}3}]:} \PY{n}{odd\PYZus{}nums} \PY{o}{=} \PY{n}{np}\PY{o}{.}\PY{n}{array}\PY{p}{(}\PY{p}{[}\PY{l+m+mi}{1}\PY{p}{,}\PY{l+m+mi}{3}\PY{p}{,}\PY{l+m+mi}{5}\PY{p}{,}\PY{l+m+mi}{7}\PY{p}{,}\PY{l+m+mi}{9}\PY{p}{,}\PY{l+m+mi}{11}\PY{p}{,}\PY{l+m+mi}{13}\PY{p}{]}\PY{p}{)}

    Again - you can check that your completed

on the odd\_nums sequence - you should get the above output.

    \subsection{1.3 Splitting into training and testing
sets}\label{splitting-into-training-and-testing-sets}

In order to perform proper testing on our dataset we will lop off the
last 1/3 of it for validation (or testing). This is that once we train
our model we have something to test it on (like any regression
problem!). This splitting into training/testing sets is done in the cell
below.

Note how here we are \textbf{not} splitting the dataset \emph{randomly}
as one typically would do when validating a regression model. This is
because our input/output pairs \emph{are related temporally}. We don't
want to validate our model by training on a random subset of the series
and then testing on another random subset, as this simulates the
scenario that we receive new points \emph{within the timeframe of our
training set}.

We want to train on one solid chunk of the series (in our case, the
first full 2/3 of it), and validate on a later chunk (the last 1/3) as
this simulates how we would predict \emph{future} values of a time
series.

    \subsection{1.4 Build and run an RNN regression
model}\label{build-and-run-an-rnn-regression-model}

Having created input/output pairs out of our time series and cut this
into training/testing sets, we can now begin setting up our RNN. We use
Keras to quickly build a two hidden layer RNN of the following
specifications

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  layer 1 uses an LSTM module with 5 hidden units (note here the
  input\_shape = (window\_size,1))
\item
  layer 2 uses a fully connected module with one unit
\item
  the 'mean\_squared\_error' loss should be used (remember: we are
  performing regression here)
\end{itemize}

This can be constructed using just a few lines - see e.g., the
\href{https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/}{general
Keras documentation} and the
\href{https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/}{LSTM documentation in
particular} for examples of how to quickly use Keras to build neural
network models. Make sure you are initializing your optimizer given the
\href{https://keras.io/optimizers/}{keras-recommended approach for RNNs}

(given in the cell below). (remember to copy your completed function

    \section{Problem 2: Create a sequence
generator}\label{problem-2-create-a-sequence-generator}

    \subsection{2.1 Getting started}\label{getting-started}

In this project you will implement a popular Recurrent Neural Network
(RNN) architecture to create an English language sequence generator
capable of building semi-coherent English sentences from scratch by
building them up character-by-character. This will require a substantial
amount amount of parameter tuning on a large training corpus (at least
100,000 characters long). In particular for this project we will be
using a complete version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic book The
Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.

How can we train a machine learning model to generate text
automatically, character-by-character? \emph{By showing the model many
training examples so it can learn a pattern between input and output.}
With this type of text generation each input is a string of valid
characters like this one

\emph{dogs are grea}

while the corresponding output is the next character in the sentence -
which here is 't' (since the complete sentence is 'dogs are great'). We
need to show a model many such examples in order for it to make
reasonable predictions.

\textbf{Fun note:} For those interested in how text generation is being
used check out some of the following fun resources:

    \subsection{2.2 Preprocessing a text
dataset}\label{preprocessing-a-text-dataset}

Our first task is to get a large text corpus for use in training, and on
it we perform a several light pre-processing tasks. The default corpus
we will use is the classic book Sherlock Holmes, but you can use a
variety of others as well - so long as they are fairly large (around
100,000 characters or more).

creating sentences of English words automatically by building up each

words. In other words - we need to remove all of the other characters

    \subsection{2.3 Cutting data into input/output
pairs}\label{cutting-data-into-inputoutput-pairs}

Now that we have our text all cleaned up, how can we use it to train a
model to generate sentences automatically? First we need to train a
machine learning model - and in order to do that we need a set of
input/output pairs for a model to train on. How can we create a set of
input/output pairs from our text to train on?

Remember in part 1 of this notebook how we used a sliding window to
extract input/output pairs from a time series? We do the same thing
here! We slide a window of length \(T\) along our giant text corpus -
everything in the window becomes one input while the character following
becomes its corresponding output. This process of extracting
input/output pairs is illustrated in the gif below on a small example
text using a window size of T = 5.

Notice one aspect of the sliding window in this gif that does not mirror
the analogous gif for time series shown in part 1 of the notebook - we
do not need to slide the window along one character at a time but can
move by a fixed step size \(M\) greater than 1 (in the gif indeed
\(M = 1\)). This is done with large input texts (like ours which has
over 500,000 characters!) when sliding the window along one character at
a time we would create far too many input/output pairs to be able to
reasonably compute with.

More formally lets denote our text corpus - which is one long string of
characters - as follows

\[s_{0},s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{P}\]

where \(P\) is the length of the text (again for our text
\(P \approx 500,000!\)). Sliding a window of size T = 5 with a step
length of M = 1 (these are the parameters shown in the gif above) over
this sequence produces the following list of input/output pairs

\[\begin{array}{c|c}
\text{Input} & \text{Output}\\
\hline \color{CornflowerBlue} {\langle s_{1},s_{2},s_{3},s_{4},s_{5}\rangle} & \color{Goldenrod}{ s_{6}} \\
\ \color{CornflowerBlue} {\langle s_{2},s_{3},s_{4},s_{5},s_{6} \rangle } & \color{Goldenrod} {s_{7} } \\
\color{CornflowerBlue}  {\vdots} & \color{Goldenrod} {\vdots}\\
\color{CornflowerBlue} { \langle s_{P-5},s_{P-4},s_{P-3},s_{P-2},s_{P-1} \rangle } & \color{Goldenrod} {s_{P}}
\end{array}\]

Notice here that each input is a sequence (or vector) of 5 characters
(and in general has length equal to the window size T) while each
corresponding output is a single character. We created around P total
number of input/output pairs (for general step size M we create around
ceil(P/M) pairs).

    Now its time for you to window the input time series as described above!

\textbf{TODO:} Create a function that runs a sliding window along the
input text and creates associated input/output pairs. A skeleton
function has been provided for you. Note that this function should input
a) the text b) the window size and c) the step size, and return the
input/output sequences. Note: the return items should be \emph{lists} -
not numpy arrays.

(remember to copy your completed function into the script
\emph{my\_answers.py} function titled \emph{window\_transform\_text}
before submitting your project)

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}20}]:} \PY{c+c1}{\PYZsh{}\PYZsh{}\PYZsh{} TODO: implement window\PYZus{}transform\PYZus{}series in my\PYZus{}answers.py}

\end{Verbatim}


    With our function complete we can now use it to produce input/output
pairs! We employ the function in the next cell, where the window\_size =

    \subsection{2.4 Wait, what kind of problem is text generation
again?}\label{wait-what-kind-of-problem-is-text-generation-again}

In part 1 of this notebook we used the same pre-processing technique -
the sliding window - to produce a set of training input/output pairs to
tackle the problem of time series prediction \emph{by treating the
problem as one of regression}. So what sort of problem do we have here
now, with text generation? Well, the time series prediction was a
regression problem because the output (one value of the time series) was
a continuous value. Here - for character-by-character text generation -
each output is a \emph{single character}. This isn't a continuous value
- but a distinct class - therefore \textbf{character-by-character text
generation is a classification problem}.

How many classes are there in the data? Well, the number of classes is
equal to the number of unique characters we have to predict! How many of
those were there in our dataset again? Lets print out the value again.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}23}]:} \PY{c+c1}{\PYZsh{} print out the number of unique characters in the dataset}
         \PY{n}{chars} \PY{o}{=} \PY{n+nb}{sorted}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n+nb}{list}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n+nb}{set}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{text}\PY{p}{)}\PY{p}{)}\PY{p}{)}

         \PY{n+nb}{print} \PY{p}{(}\PY{l+s+s1}{\PYZsq{}}\PY{l+s+s1}{and these characters are }\PY{l+s+s1}{\PYZsq{}}\PY{p}{)}
         \PY{n+nb}{print} \PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{chars}\PY{p}{)}
\end{Verbatim}


    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
this corpus has 33 unique characters
and these characters are 
[' ', '!', ',', '.', ':', ';', '?', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']

    \end{Verbatim}

    Rockin' - so we have a multiclass classification problem on our hands!

    \subsection{2.5 One-hot encoding
characters}\label{one-hot-encoding-characters}

The last issue we have to deal with is representing our text data as
numerical data so that we can use it as an input to a neural network.
One of the conceptually simplest ways of doing this is via a 'one-hot
encoding' scheme. Here's how it works.

We transform each character in our inputs/outputs into a vector with
length equal to the number of unique characters in our text. This vector
is all zeros except one location where we place a 1 - and this location
is unique to each character type. e.g., we transform 'a', 'b', and 'c'
as follows

\[a\longleftarrow\left[\begin{array}{c}
1\\
0\\
0\\
\vdots\\
0\\
0
\end{array}\right]\,\,\,\,\,\,\,b\longleftarrow\left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
1\\
0\\
\vdots\\
0\\
0
\end{array}\right]\,\,\,\,\,c\longleftarrow\left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
0\\
1\\
\vdots\\
0\\
0 
\end{array}\right]\cdots\]

where each vector has 32 entries (or in general: number of entries =
number of unique characters in text).

    The first practical step towards doing this one-hot encoding is to form
a dictionary mapping each unique character to a unique integer, and one
dictionary to do the reverse mapping. We can then use these dictionaries
to quickly make our one-hot encodings, as well as re-translate (from
integers to characters) the results of our trained RNN classification
model.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}24}]:} \PY{c+c1}{\PYZsh{} this dictionary is a function mapping each unique character to a unique integer}
         \PY{n}{chars\PYZus{}to\PYZus{}indices} \PY{o}{=} \PY{n+nb}{dict}\PY{p}{(}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{c}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{i}\PY{p}{)} \PY{k}{for} \PY{n}{i}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{c} \PY{o+ow}{in} \PY{n+nb}{enumerate}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{chars}\PY{p}{)}\PY{p}{)}  \PY{c+c1}{\PYZsh{} map each unique character to unique integer}
         
         \PY{c+c1}{\PYZsh{} this dictionary is a function mapping each unique integer back to a unique character}
         \PY{n}{indices\PYZus{}to\PYZus{}chars} \PY{o}{=} \PY{n+nb}{dict}\PY{p}{(}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{i}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{c}\PY{p}{)} \PY{k}{for} \PY{n}{i}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{c} \PY{o+ow}{in} \PY{n+nb}{enumerate}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{chars}\PY{p}{)}\PY{p}{)}  \PY{c+c1}{\PYZsh{} map each unique integer back to unique character}
\end{Verbatim}


    Now we can transform our input/output pairs - consisting of characters -
to equivalent input/output pairs made up of one-hot encoded vectors. In
the next cell we provide a function for doing just this: it takes in the
raw character input/outputs and returns their numerical versions. In
particular the numerical input is given as \(\bf{X}\), and numerical
output is given as the \(\bf{y}\)

\end{Verbatim}

    \subsection{2.6 Setting up our RNN}\label{setting-up-our-rnn}

With our dataset loaded and the input/output pairs extracted /
transformed we can now begin setting up our RNN for training. Again we
will use Keras to quickly build a single hidden layer RNN - where our
hidden layer consists of LSTM modules.

Time to get to work: build a 3 layer RNN model of the following
specification

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  layer 1 should be an LSTM module with 200 hidden units
  -\/-\textgreater{} note this should have input\_shape =
  (window\_size,len(chars)) where len(chars) = number of unique
  characters in your cleaned text
\item
  layer 2 should be a linear module, fully connected, with len(chars)
  hidden units -\/-\textgreater{} where len(chars) = number of unique
  characters in your cleaned text
\item
  layer 3 should be a softmax activation ( since we are solving a
  \emph{multiclass classification})
\item
  Use the \textbf{categorical\_crossentropy} loss
\end{itemize}

This network can be constructed using just a few lines - as with the RNN
network you made in part 1 of this notebook. See e.g., the
\href{https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/}{general
Keras documentation} and the
\href{https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/}{LSTM documentation in
particular} for examples of how to quickly use Keras to build neural
network models.

    How do we make a given number of predictions (characters) based on this
fitted model?

First we predict the next character after following any chunk of
characters in the text of length equal to our chosen window size. Then
we remove the first character in our input sequence and tack our
prediction onto the end. This gives us a slightly changed sequence of
inputs that still has length equal to the size of our window. We then
feed in this updated input sequence into the model to predict the
another character. Together then we have two predicted characters
following our original input sequence. Repeating this process N times
gives us N predicted characters.

In the next Python cell we provide you with a completed function that
does just this - it makes predictions when given a) a trained RNN model,
b) a subset of (window\_size) characters from the text, and c) a number
of characters to predict (to follow our input subset).

    With your trained model try a few subsets of the complete text as input
- note the length of each must be exactly equal to the window size. For

    This looks ok, but not great. Now lets try the same experiment with a
larger chunk of the data - with the first 100,000 input/output pairs.

Tuning RNNs for a typical character dataset like the one we will use
here is a computationally intensive endeavour and thus timely on a
typical CPU. Using a reasonably sized cloud-based GPU can speed up
training by a factor of 10. Also because of the long training time it is
highly recommended that you carefully write the output of each step of
your process to file. This is so that all of your results are saved even
if you close the web browser you're working out of, as the processes
will continue processing in the background but variables/output in the
notebook system will not update when you open it again.

In the next cell we show you how to create a text file in Python and
record data to it. This sort of setup can be used to record your final
predictions.

    With this recording devices we can now more safely perform experiments
on larger portions of the text. In the next cell we will use the first
100,000 input/output pairs to train our RNN model.

    First we fit our model to the dataset, then generate text using the
trained model in precisely the same generation method applied before on
the small dataset.

\textbf{Note:} your generated words should be - by and large - more
realistic than with the small dataset, but you won't be able to generate
perfect English sentences even with this amount of data. A rule of
thumb: your model is working well if you generate sentences that largely
contain real English words.
